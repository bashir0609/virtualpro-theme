# 🔧 Fix "islah_tw" Theme Name Display

## The Issue

WordPress shows the theme folder name, not the theme name from `style.css`. Your theme folder is still named `islah_tw`.

## ✅ Solution: Rename Theme Folder

### Method 1: Via FTP/File Manager (Recommended)

1. **Connect to your WordPress site** via FTP or cPanel File Manager
2. Navigate to `wp-content/themes/`
3. **Rename** the folder from `islah_tw` to `virtualpro`
4. Go to WordPress Admin → **Appearance** → **Themes**
5. The theme will now show as **"VirtualPro"**

### Method 2: Fresh Install with Correct ZIP

1. **Deactivate** the current theme (activate a default theme like Twenty Twenty-Four)
2. **Delete** the `islah_tw` theme
3. **Upload** the new `virtualpro.zip` file:
   - Go to **Appearance** → **Themes** → **Add New** → **Upload Theme**
   - Choose `virtualpro.zip` from your computer
   - Install and activate

## 📦 The Correct ZIP File

The `virtualpro.zip` created by `npm run bundle` has the correct structure:

```
virtualpro/          ← Correct folder name
├── style.css
├── functions.php
├── index.php
└── ...
```
